\#### <a name='iterm2'></a> iTerm2
\- OS X's terminal is fine, but personally find it lacking.
\- OS X's stock terminal not maximizing is one of my biggest pet peeves.
\- So that's where \[iTerm2\]([https://www.iterm2.com/](https://www.iterm2.com/ "https://www.iterm2.com/"))  comes into the picture.

Couple of tricks to make iTerm2 even better.

To jump between words and start/end of lines in iTerm2 follow these steps:

iTerm2 -> Preferences (‚åò + ,)
Open the ‚ÄúKeys‚Äù tab

Add the following Global Shortcut Keys

\`\`\`
Move cursor one word left
Keyboard Combination: \`‚å• + ‚Üê\`
Action: Send Hex Code
Code: 0x1b 0x62

Move cursor one word right
Keyboard Combination: \`‚å• + ‚Üí\`
Action: Send Hex Code
Code: \`0x1b 0x66\`

Move cursor to beginning of line
Keyboard Combination: ‚åò + ‚Üê
Action: Send Hex Code
Code: \`0x01\`

Move cursor to end of line
Keyboard Combination: ‚åò + ‚Üí
Action: Send Hex Code
Code: \`0x05\`

Delete word
Keyboard Combination: ‚å• + ‚ÜêDelete
Action: Send Hex Code
Code: 0x1b 0x08

Delete line
Keyboard Combination: ‚åò + ‚ÜêDelete
Action: Send Hex Code
Code: 0x15

Undo
Keyboard Combination: ‚åò + z
Action: Send Hex Code
Code: 0x1f
\`\`\`
Don't forget to remove the previous bindings:

Open the ‚ÄúProfiles‚Äù tab
Click the sub-tab ‚ÄùKeys‚Äù
Remove the mappings for key combinations ‚å• + ‚Üê and ‚å• + ‚Üí

\#### <a name=fantastical></a> Fantastical
\- \[Fantastical\]([https://flexibits.com/fantastical](https://flexibits.com/fantastical "https://flexibits.com/fantastical")) It's a third party calendar manager which is excellent at it's job.
\- I could go into detail as to what's good about it, but since it has 21 day trial take it for a whirl.


\#### <a name=vanilla></a> Vanilla
\- \[Vaniila\]([https://matthewpalmer.net/vanilla/](https://matthewpalmer.net/vanilla/ "https://matthewpalmer.net/vanilla/")) hides stuff in your menu bar.
\- It was so good I bought it üòä.

\#### <a name='amphetamine'/></a> Amphetamine

\### <a name='command-line-utilities'></a> Command-line Utilities

\#### <a name='homebrew'></a> Homebrew
\- You probably have this installed on your macbook, if not please go ahead and install it.
\- Homebrew is more or less essential to installing any utility on your mac and it does so in a jiffy.
  - You could install stuff without homebrew, but why would you want to do so when homebrew does it for you easily.
